# Gnobesy: Guild Bank Enhancement System

This is a maintenance fork of the Gnobesy: Guild Bank Enhancement System addon for World of Warcraft.

## Description

NEW! Congratulations on acquiring Gnobesy: the GNOmish guild Bank Enhancement SYstem.

This is a new Guild Bank sort addon, that will also include some other enhancements. Currently you can sort (regular or reverse) or quickly reach the Guild Control panel from the bank, where you can change bank permissions.

This is a new release, and I expect to push out some more updates very quickly.

## To support this addon

Let me know in the comments if you enjoy it, and any suggestions you might have
but also let me know if you don't, and what might improve it
or you can buy me a drink if you like
 

## Roadmap

- add methods to detect the closing the of Gbank window, abort when that happens
- investigate possibly integrating with other addons like TSM - to help quickly identify items that may sell well in the AH
- more fun!
